# Minimal-Todo

This is a project to create a ToDo app that I want to use.

## Reference

- I made a Minimal-Todo project while studying Android architecture through a great project, **[android/architecture-samples](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples)**.

- I will continue to reflect the study contents in the **Minimal-Todo** project and create a cool ToDo app.

## What I Use?

`kotlin`, `MVVM`, `DataBinding`, `LiveData`
